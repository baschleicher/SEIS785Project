# Onelook
Class Project for IoT Class

My project is a calendar event notifier that is automatically triggered when my Office 365 calendar has an upcoming event. I am using the OFfice 365 Calendar channel in IFTTT to trigger an action using the Particle channel to publish an event that my Onelook device is subscribed to. Once the Onelook receives an event it starts a countdown timer that is displayed on a Particle Internet Button that allows a user to quickly glance at the device and see how long it is until the meeting starts so that they can make sure to leave on time to get there.

As an additional feature, the Onelook includes the ability to push a button and turn on all of the LEDs to show red to signify a Do Not Disturb, as this is something that my department is considering to try and help people when they have something high priority that they are working on.
